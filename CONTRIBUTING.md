## Development setup

### Pre-requisites

To get started, you'll need a few handy development tools - these are common tools that you might already be using:
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), an extremely fast Python package and project manager.
- [just](https://just.systems/man/en/introduction.html), a cross-platform equivalent of Makefile to run tasks.

### Installation

Let's get you up and running with the project. Here's how to set it up:

1. First, clone the project to your computer by running:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/
   ```

2. Once that's done, head to the main project folder and run our setup command:
   ```bash
   just setup
   ```

This setup command takes care of all the project configuration for you - it handles your linting rules, testing framework, documentation tools, and packaging settings. You'll be ready to start developing right away!
